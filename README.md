# Materia Widget Development Kit (MWDK)

The Materia Widget Development Kit (MWDK) is designed to facilitate the rapid development of widgets for use in [Materia](https://github.com/ucfopen/Materia). It is a required dependency of all widgets, and in addition to providing in-situ player and creator interfaces, the MWDK enables quick installation to a local Materia instance and compiling the widget for production use.
